## Incremental Predictive Coding for training Neural Network ðŸ§ 
#### Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00720

#### Alternative to standard training algorithm Backpropagation.

## Training Dataset
#### Training samples - 50,000
#### Test samples - 10,000

## Handwriting Digit Recognition
#### Model takes 28x28 input image and it will predict wether the image is digit 0-9

### For comparison I train a Neural Network with two different Training Algorithm IPC vs Backpropagation

### After training for 20 epochs/iterations:

Backpropagation result: 92% Accuracy!
